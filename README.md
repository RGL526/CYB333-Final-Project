# CYB333-Final-Project
The purpose of this code is to extract file information from a PCAP file. The idea is to capture TCP or UDP file transfers and to be able to pull file type or even the complete file. 
The initial coding took 4 hours to write and was only able to identify a .zip file extension. The issue I was having was identifying individual packets. To overcome this I had to create sessions that looked for packets that contained the same destination and orgin IP and Port numbers in them. This success made it possible to bracket in on a set of packets for a file transfer. If it could not find a packet set it would create a new session and start again to search.
My next success is able to identify .doc and .exe files. My next goal is to parse more of the packet session out and determine which IP initiated the file transfer.
